# Privacy Policy for Speaking with Myself

**Last Updated: January 30, 2026**

## Overview

Speaking with Myself ("the App") is a personal reflection and journaling app designed to help you build a kinder inner voice through daily prompts. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how we handle your information.

## Data Collection and Storage

**We do not collect any personal data.**

All information you enter into the App—including your reflections, topic selections, and preferences—is stored locally on your device only. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any servers, cloud services, or third parties.

### What stays on your device:
- Your daily reflections and journal entries
- Your selected topics and progress
- App preferences and settings
- Notification preferences

### What we do NOT have access to:
- Your reflections or any text you enter
- Your usage patterns or habits
- Your device information
- Your location
- Any personal identifiers

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. There are no ads in the App.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data because we do not collect any data. Your reflections are yours alone.

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it:
- Delete individual reflections within the App
- Clear all data using the App's settings
- Uninstall the App to remove all associated data

## Notifications

If you enable daily reminders, the App uses Apple's local notification system. These notifications are scheduled entirely on your device and do not involve any external servers.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The App is intended for general audiences seeking personal growth and reflection.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will post the new version within the App and update the "Last Updated" date above.
